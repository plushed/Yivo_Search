# Yivo_Search

## Introduction
Yivo Search is a tool developed to provide quick analysis of URLs against multiple Open Source Intelligence feeds. Results are stored in a SQlite database and displayed when queried. Current sources include URLScan.io, Google Safe Search API, OpenPhish Feed, Phishtank, Virustotal, and McAfee Web Advisor. I hope to include additional modules in the near future.
